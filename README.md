1. Application calls the purchase method of Qonversion SDK.
2. Qonversion SDK communicates with StoreKit or Google Billing Client to make a purchase.
3. If a purchase is successful, the SDK sends a request to Qonversion API for server-to-server purchase validation. Qonversion server receives accurate information on the in-app purchase status and user entitlements.
4. SDK returns control to the application with a processing state.
