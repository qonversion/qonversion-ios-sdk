## Simple Installation:

### CocoaPods

1. Add `pod 'Qonversion'` in your pod file.

2. Run `pod install`

3. In your `AppDelegate` in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method, setup the SDK like so:

```swift
import Qonversion

Qonversion.launch(withKey: "projectKey") { userID in
    FBSDKAppEvents.setUserID(uid)
}
```


#### Now you will see all purchases in your Facebook Ad account, even if they happen after trial period or app removal (but only in 28-days window - it's a Facebook rule).

SDK will automatically track any purchase events (subscriptions, trials, basic purchases). But If you want to track purchases manually, you can pass `false` in `autoTrackPurchases` and call `trackPurchase:transaction:` on every purchase event in your application.
